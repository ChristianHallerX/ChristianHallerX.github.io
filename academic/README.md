## Statement of Research

### Overview of the field

Shelf and coastal regions are the front lines in societal challenges of climate change, environmental policy, and resource exploration and management. For geological research they play an important role as geologic records of paleo-climate, reservoirs of hydrocarbons, and past sea-level, and deposits of erosional products of mountain ranges. Even though such marginal marine environments, from coastal to shelf edge, have the potential to comprise strongly expanded sections with substantial interest for study, there are still many blank spots on the geologic map. The inability to obtain complete, and undisturbed records from offshore regions looms as a large obstacle to (marine) geologists. While estuarine environments can be sampled with smaller budgets, water depth typically scales with costliness, but also length of the records obtainable. High-resolution sections can be found in delta regions with intense basin subsidence from siliciclastic input, and in the carbonate-depositional regions of the world. Basin Modeling is the discipline for reconstructing events in a sediment sink area, taking inputs from many sub-disciplines on various scales that have to be interpreted in context of each other.

Microfossil-related proxy data is used to make inferences about age of strata and also (paleo-) bathymetric and paleoenvironmental estimates that are incorporated into models of basin history. Geochemical (e.g., stable isotopes, elemental composition), and mineralogy from fossils and bulk sediment are used to fingerprint, sediment provenance, temperature, salinity, and other parameters by which sites can be compared with each other. Seismic surveys are useful to visualize large-scale and low-resolution distribution of formations (or more so impedance differences). However, most what is known today is based on parameterizations, assumptions and lateral extrapolation. Unfortunately, these assumptions are known to be a significant source of errors in many basin models, especially if they are not in areas of commercial interest.

To bring all the mentioned disciplines together in a meaningful way, it is inescapable to retrieve geological samples and ground-truth assumptions in context of modern analogues in contemporary sedimentary research. In my research, I strive to establish a better understanding of the shelf depositional realm and find ways to improve on estimates made in paleoenvironmental and (paleo-)bathymetric aspects in basin models.

### Past and ongoing work

Reconstructing histories of marginal marine and shelf processes is carried out to inform about future developments. For example, researching past analogues of possible future states of the earth, which is allowed through analyzing and interpreting marine sedimentary records. A significant portion of my work has dealt with such reconstructions. Employing tools such as age-depth models and microfacies analyses in challenging environments from coastal marine to shelf-edge, on engineering time scales to Neogene age, I, together with my coauthors have studied the siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary, paleontological, paleoenvironmental, and paleoceanographic properties of such marine sediment records. We have identified strengths and weaknesses of performance of quantitative sea-level reconstructions using intertidal microfossils, i.e., their reliance on very-well assembled modern training sets particularly in regions of low tidal range such as the Gulf of Mexico (Alabama/Mississippi). These findings are of significance to the efforts of improving the model accuracy in low tidal-range marsh regions of the world.

One on my ongoing coastal projects focuses on comparison of sites using multiple cores from different types of estuarine marshes. The project highlights the pitfalls that can occur in delta areas of sediment supply re-routing (stream piracy). The goal of this project is to highlight the danger of making false assumptions on secular sediment supply rates in a delta setting that may be unwarranted or idealized. Backstepping erosion due to sediment-starvation and thus variable sedimentation rates may yield biased sea-level rise rates and de-validate the reconstruction. While previous inter-tidal studies have concentrated on a single sedimentary core without a reference, this project supplies multiple sediment cores from different settings in a region (backbarrier marsh vs. mainland marsh/delta). The project has already yielded meaningful constraints and is currently receiving more radiocarbon dates for further error improvements in Bayesian age-modeling.

In my carbonate shelves-related work we have carried out comparisons between sub-tropical and tropical foraminiferal microfaunas of the (Western Australian) shelf, which were traced back to the Miocene when modern, shelf-shaping currents were established. We have, for instance, discovered that the warm Western Australian Leeuwin Current is largely moderated by tectonic activity in the Indonesian archipelago and a driver of carbonate production. The warm coastal current has significant influence on suppression of upwelling, sea-surface productivity on the WA shelf. Microfossil analysis yielded that the Leeuwin Current intensity varied strongly over time and reached a maximum around 1 Ma in the Pleistocene indicated by sponge spicules, when significant reef bodies, such as the Ningaloo Reef, that benefited from the warm water delivery were established simultaneously. The onset of the Leuwin Current is characterized by a switch from opportunistic foraminiferal assemblages to diverse mid- to inner-shelf and increasing sedimentation rates and shelf progradation caused by the authigenic shelf infill with skeletal detritus and carbonate silt originating from the “Carbonate Factory”.


### Future Projects
 
**Project 1: The Sea-Level Rise in the marginal Gulf of Mexico**

There is a knowledge gap when it comes to continuous and high-resolution sea-level data of Quaternary strata in the Gulf of Mexico. While many studies have focused on basal peat (first radiocarbon-datable sediment deposited at sea-level), these studies may be compromised by far-reaching post-glacial isostatic rebound effects, compaction (vertical displacement), and natural delta subsidence through natural compaction and hydrocarbon extraction. Numerous studies focus on microfossil-deducted sea level on the U.S. eastern seaboard where tidal ranges are relatively high, and resolution is generally sufficient for acceptable vertical reconstruction model error. However, Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico has been relatively neglected and only a single study with a single sediment core addressed to date the challenge. Florida is located on an ancient carbonate province, which is vertically relatively stable, impervious from sediment compaction and subsidence, and suffers very little from effects of the post-glacial rebound as measured by satellite and GPS. As a consequence, this makes the Florida peninsula a prime location for Gulf of Mexico sea-level reconstruction compared to the western and northern Gulf of Mexico. Given our results from the Mississippi/Alabama coastline, low tidal ranges can be assessed with adequate vertical error of reconstructed sea level reconstructions. Global eustatic sea-level measurements and reconstructions are not always reflecting local the events due to other oceanographic factors affecting this phenomenon. Therefore, these efforts will contribute to our ability to predict future sea level in the Gulf of Mexico in particular. Creating such models remains one of the most difficult challenges in the field of marginal marine geology as it requires a thorough geologic history assessment of the study area, creation of a training set, and adoption and refinement of cutting-edge algorithms for age-depth models and vertical reconstruction models. 
 
A large number of different parameters is being used in sea-level modeling. Minimization of the partial errors contributing to the overall vertical reconstruction error is a primary goal. Consequently, another intriguing related topic is the incorporation of the effects of sediment autocompaction from highly organic sediments into age-depth models. This could correct the vertical shrinkage caused by loading of subsequent deposition of high-bulk density sediment layers for example from storm overwash. Such modeling will be achieved by building on the work done in fine resolution state-of-the-art 1-D numerical models.

**Project 2: Extension of the Leeuwin Current (Western Australia) through time**

Previous studies presented evidence that the intensity of the Leeuwin Current (running from north West Australia to the Australian Bight) is moderated by (1) the configuration of tectonically active gateways in the Indonesian Archipelago, which enable connectivity with the Western Pacific Warm Pool, (2) sea level, which is controlling the number of flooded tectonic gateways, and (3) monsoonal wind patterns associated with interglacials and glacials having increasing or attenuating effects.  For example, these studies made the case that the Leeuwin Current was thinner and ended in the Cape Range-Region during the Last Glacial Maximum (at ~20,000 ka), giving way to upwelling conditions on the Australian south western shelf. Current knowledge is limited to few cores and for an improved understanding of timing and correlation with global events desperately requires increase in latitudinal resolution. My goal is to obtain multiple sediment cores and/or analyze existing cores from the WA shelf on a latitudinal transect to trace the extend and intensity of the current in a resolution sufficient to correlate with glacial cycles in oxygen isotopes.

Currently there are several cycles of seismically-induced shelf failures recognized that created widespread Mass-Transport Complexes (allochthonous slides/deformed sediment) on the outer shelf and slope that were modeled by the resource industry. Hence, there is the potential to track Leeuwin Current-induced shelf progradation in 2D and 3D seismic data. A more comprehensive combined interpretation of sediment properties from core material with industrial and federal seismic data generated during the last two decades will draw a more complete picture of Leewuwin Current activity.

**Project 3: State switching in carbonate ramps vs. glass ramps**

Carbonate ramps, such as the WA shelf, are marginal marine settings in which carbonate organisms are dominant producers, which is typically termed the “Carbonate Factory”. These carbonate provinces are studied as modern analogs for example in the Bahamas, a classic study location for classic carbonate ramp facies with constituents such as ooids, stromatolites, coral reef organisms. Glass ramps are a new geological depositional model recognized in the recent decade that resemble carbonate ramps in overall geomorphic structure and temporally alternate with carbonate ramps. While glass ramps have been found to be common on inner ramp environments at certain times in the Phanerozoic, they are dominated by siliceous demosponges. The carbonate and glass ramp settings are defined by relative abundance of carbonate and siliceous sediment such as sponge spicules on a non-linear scale – likely with hysteresis (i.e., lagging behind changes in the effect causing it) and sudden switching behavior. However, a lack of full modern analogues, precludes a comparison with modern, deep-water siliceous sponge meadows and hence, glass ramps must have faced environmental challenges different from those of modern sponge meadows.

Statement

### Vision

Geological phenomena, terrestrial and marine, have been observed for centuries. Explanations that were once mythical and arbitrary have evolved to become scientific and predictive, beginning with Hutton's first map of British geology. With the aid of today’s technology, the rate at which we can model and test new theories is simply unprecedented; and new paradigms like cloud computing and big data are poised to increase these capabilities by orders of magnitude in the near future. It is therefore imperative that tomorrow’s geologists are equipped not only with sharp scientific minds, but also the creativity to conceive of new theories, and the technological prowess to model and test those theories. As an educator, I will strive to instill in each student the right balance across these disciplines so as to position them for success in academia and beyond.

My work as a teaching assistant, research assistant, and laboratory mentor at University of Bonn, University of South Florida, and USGS have given me pedagogical foundation on which to build. This experience has offered invaluable insights into the learning process in general whether in the classroom, the field, and the laboratory. My intention is to draw from this experience and insight to engage students in highly interactive, collaborative, and creative way, while leveraging technology and encouraging its use in problem-solving.

Tactically speaking, I believe that effective learning environments exhibit the following traits:

- Instructors are partners; they should be welcoming and open, not intimidating. The classroom is a place for dialogue between the teacher and the students.
- Creativity in developing theories is key in the geosciences. How certain outcomes have come about is not always clear to the geologist. Therefore it is absolutely important to have the creativity and background knowledge to develop ~10 hypotheses for the genetic history of an outcrop.
- Less is sometimes more. While the instructor must be cognizant to cover the material comprehensively, it is equally important to recognize the point at which more information would be counter-productive.
- Repetition is important. Previously covered materials should be revisited, and understanding reaffirmed continuously.
- Newly-learned topics should be put into perspective of the greater picture by the instructor.

<br>

I am prepared to teach courses related to marine geological processes, sedimentology, and (paleo)oceanography. What follows are examples of the type of activities one can expect to see in my classroom:

- Students will be guided through the theoretical foundation of each topic, starting from the first principles and then building on that with practical examples.
- I will promote healthy skepticism and scrutiny, and in so doing I will help students recognize the caveats and underlying assumptions.
- Variable teaching methods will be used to keep things fresh and engaging.
- Field experiences are essential to study outcrops or modern analogs ("The best geologist is who has seen the most rocks" H.H. Read, 1940).
- Assignments will incorporate the use of state-of-the-art technology whenever useful.
- For those interested in more advanced details related to the topic at hand, links to supplementary materials will be provided during each lesson.
- Thesis support will be given as my expertise fits.
