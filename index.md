My website is about my work, my research, and what I am passionate about.

I am looking to collaborate on open source projects!


### Doing

- Optimizing well-log classifictions.
- Preparing for the Datathon/Hackathon season. All online? Ugh!
- Should I train a Deep Racer???
- Besides the blog entries, check my technical notebooks in the <a href="https://github.com/ChristianHallerX/DataScienceProjects" target="_blank">GitHub Repository "Data Science Projects"</a> for latest work.
	
	
### Learning

- Deployment of Tensorflow models to edge devices. Very promising, so far.
- Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
- To Dash or not to Dash.


### Reading

I usually have a few books on the go. One or two smart books and a sci-fi selection for bedtime reading or as audiobook in the gym.

- Clive Thompson (2019) Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World
- Kal Mishra (2018) Heard In Data Science Interviews: Over 650 Most Commonly Asked Interview Questions & Answers
- M. Crichton & R. Preston (2011) Micro: A Novel
