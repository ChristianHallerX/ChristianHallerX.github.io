Christian is very detail oriented, consistent, and very knowledgeable.
Working with him in the past and even beyond that I have enjoyed his teamwork ability and always admired how he handled difficult tasks and situations.
Every task he is given is brought to completion in a way that I have not seen often.
Besides work, he is a fun person to hang out with.
I hope that our professional paths will cross many times in the future.
