Content talks! My website is about my work, my research, and what I am passionate about.

I am looking to collaborate on open source projects!

### Doing

- Optimizing well-log classifictions.
- Preparing for the Datathon/Hackathon season. All online? Ugh!
- Should I train a Deep Racer???
	
	
### Learning

- Deployment of Tensorflow models to edge devices. Very promising, so far.
- Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
- Dash


### Reading

I usually have a few books on the go. One or two smart books and a sci-fi selection for bedtime reading or as audiobook in the gym.
