# About

Christian is a rising `Geologist` who knows how to talk to computers, and has a proficiency in the hottest subject of our time: `Data Science`, and `Machine Learning` models.
These models are used to analyze wireline logs and seismic data to simplify facies recognition, interpretation, and well-log correlation.
Previously a researcher in pure geology, he has watched every talk by Dr. Andrew Ng ever recorded, and is now specializing in `Deep Learning` and its applications.
During his time in academia, Christian has sailed on geological offshore (drilling) expeditions and published various technical papers.
