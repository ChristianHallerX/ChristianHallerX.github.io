## Bio

Christian holds a Ph.D. in `Marine Science`, an M.Sc. in `Geoscience`, and has a strong computer programming background.
He has a proficiency in one of the hottest subjects of our time: `Data Science`, and developing `Machine Learning` models.
These models are useful to analyze data to simplify class recognition, automate interpretation, and discern cause-and-effect correlation.
Furthermore, Christian creates, runs, and improves complex prediction systems in order to support organizations whose research and success metrics depend on accurate prediction.
During his time in academia, Christian has sailed on offshore expeditions (scientific drilling) and published various technical papers.

Outside his technical roles, Christian is a keen photographer and mountain biker - with a broad interest in emerging tech, economics, and management.
His favorite book is "The Martian", which he read over a dozen times.
In his downtime he and his partner pursue their passion for backpacking such as camping in the Australian Outback, the Black Forest, or the Northeast Kingdom.
