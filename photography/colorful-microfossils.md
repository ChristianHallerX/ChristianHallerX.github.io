Foraminifera lived already hundreds of millions of years ago and give valuable insights in the rock history.

They deliver valuable insights for the stratigrapher in industry and are studied in academia as modern analogues.

- Planktonic foraminifera (floating in the ocean) are commonly used for relative age dating and geochemistry of the water surface.

- Benthic foraminifera (living in/on the sediment) are applied for environmental inference and geochemical conditions at the sea floor.

Note: The fossils are between 0.1 and 1 mm in size and were imaged with a Scanning Electron Microscope.
