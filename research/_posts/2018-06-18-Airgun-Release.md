  Seismic surveying offshore requires an airgun as pressure source.

Seismic surveying offshore requires an airgun as pressure source. The has a pressure chamber, which is continuously loaded and released in an instant. The release causes a pressure wave travel trough the water column down to the sea floor and throug the rock layers. In this experiment, the hydrophone was lowered into the borehole and the one-way travel time can be measured. Typically, in most surveys there are no boreholes available and the two-way-travel time can be measured from hydrophones straming behind a survey vessel.

In this instance <a href="https://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/indonesian_throughflow.html" target="_blank">IODP Expedition 356</a> conducted a Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP)

>In a VSP experiment, a borehole seismic tool (VSI) is anchored against the borehole wall at regularly spaced intervals and records the full waveform of elastic waves generated by a seismic source positioned just below the sea surface. These “check shot” measurements relate depth in the hole to traveltime in reflection seismic profiles. The VSI used on the ship contains a three-axis geophone. In a VSP survey, the VSI was anchored against the borehole wall at approximately 25 m station intervals (where possible), with 5–10 air gun shots typically taken at each station.
