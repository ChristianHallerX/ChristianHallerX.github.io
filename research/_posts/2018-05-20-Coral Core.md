The coral reef workgroup came back with Florida Keys cores.

You can trace the polyp growth direction if you look closely.

The growth of the corals towards the sea surface leaves back a calcium carbonate skeleton.

This skeleton is biomineralized from sea water and incorporates and preserves trace elements and stable isotopes from the time the coral was alive.

Taking geochemical samples across the core allows us to recreate a detailed history of these trace elements.

These trace elements act as proxies for various parameters such as water temperature, salinity, nutrient availability, upwelling, polar ice volume etc.

These cores are not easily obtained anymore today, since coral reefs are in a bad conditon in the Florida Reef.

A lot of permiting is required to justify core extraction.

Fun fact: In the old days, several decades ago, it was common for researchers to use explosives to get large chunks of corals to study.
