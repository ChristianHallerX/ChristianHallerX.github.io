## Introduction 

<pre><code>
A Paleontologist, a Geologist, and a Geophysicist are interviewing for a job.
First, the Paleontologist is asked in to the Hiring Manager's office and the Paleontologist is shown a piece of paper with some wrtiting.
The Hiring Manager asks: "What do you see?" The Paleontologist quips "The number 4"

The Hiring Manager is continues the interview and then asks the Geologist into his office.
The Hiring Manager asks: "What do you see?" The Geologist looks at the paper and after short deliberation replies: "4.0".

Finally, the Hiring Manager beckons the Geophysicist into the office and hands him the paper.
He asks: "Geophysicist, what do you see?". The Geophysicist looks at the sheet for a long time, turns it upside down, thinks.
The Geophysicist leans forward and whispers: "What do you want it to be?"

## Flat Spots

The final step in the work with seismic data is seismic interpretation. In the scientific field called geophysics, interpretation sounds highly subjective. Very different from the usual statistics, ray and wave phenomena. How can this be right?

I would love to say that interpretation is straight forward and seismic data reveals a perfect image of the subsurface for making business decisions. But it really is not the case. Any way we manipulate seismic data has one single purpose: revert the filtering effect and noise of the subsurface on our data to make the picture clearer. Of course, each step is based on assumptions. Thinking about all the steps geophysicists undertake to clean up the image, it is sometimes amazing you can make any use of seismic data at all.

After all the pre-processing the geophysicist be left with something like this in the image below:

This seismic image above is easy on the eyes: low noise and good contrast. You can even see some hydrocarbons! At least if the interpreter knows know what they are looking at.

The upper depositional unit is made up of Pliocene-age sediments. They are layered like pan cakes, which usually indicates some kind of marine or lacustrine deposition history.

You see some strong contrasts in a rounded structure. The rounded structure consists of evaporites (e.g., salt, gypsum, anhydrite). An upward-buckling structure like that is called an **anticline** and is the most old-fashioned and easiest how the hydrocarbon industry (oil and gas) obtains their product. The hydrocarbons are lower density than the rock and water inside the rock formation so that they rise up. In such anticline structures they get trapped below a sealing (non-pearmeable) rock formation and build a reservoir.

Within this anticline structure you see something that cannot form syn-depositionally. There are two lines crossing. The convex anticline crosses an almost straight (horizontal) line. This indicates that there has to be something else causing this image. These so-called **flat spots** can be an indicator for a hydrocarbon trap as the fluid in the sediments changes the accoustic impedance for our seismic signal travelling through.

Now the really interesting piece is, that you very probably able to follow this explanation of the **flat spot**, but there is a good chance we were not looking at the same flat structure. Seismic interpreters working with a single seismic image will interpret it in different ways. The following image is a shnapshot how 39 different interpreters's opinion **<a href="https://pickthis.io" target="_blank">https://pickthis.io</a>** then a heatmap was generated.

We can explain these phenomenae scientifically, but finding them is still highly subjective. We can see that the heatmap shows many picks along the flat spot I described. This is especially interesting as I posed the challenge to pick the “hydrocarbon indication” instead of directly giving out the challenge “find the flat spot”, giving us many more interpretations.

I encourage you to sign up with **<a href="https://pickthis.io" target="_blank">https://pickthis.io</a>** and take the challenge for yourself. Only after submitting your interpretation you can see other submissions. Be relieved, there is no wrong interpretation, just look at it and get going. If you know your way in geophysical interpretation already, then this is a perfect training opportunity without wagering your company's exploration budget.
