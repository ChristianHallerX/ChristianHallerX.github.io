Statement

## Statement

Geological phenomena, terrestrial and marine, have been observed for centuries. Explanations that were once mythical and arbitrary have evolved to become scientific and predictive, beginning with Hutton's first map of British geology. With the aid of today’s technology, the rate at which we can model and test new theories is simply unprecedented; and new paradigms like cloud computing and big data are poised to increase these capabilities by orders of magnitude in the near future. It is therefore imperative that tomorrow’s geologist are equipped not only with sharp scientific minds, but also the creativity to conceive of new theories, and the technological prowess to model and test those theories. As an educator, I will strive to instill in each student the right balance across these disciplines so as to position them for success in academia and beyond.

My work as a teaching assisstant, research assistant, and laboratory mentor at University of Bonn, University of South Florida, and USGS have given me pedagogical foundation on which to build. This experience has offered invaluable insights into the learning process in general whether in the classroom, the field, and the laboratory. My intention is to draw from this experience and insight to engage students in highly interactive, collaborative, and creative way, while leveraging technology and encouraging its use in problem-solving.

Tactically speaking, I believe that effective learning environments exhibit the following traits:

- Instructors are partners; they should be welcoming and open, not intimidating. The classroom is a place for dialogue between the teacher and the students.
- Creativity in developing theories is key in the geosciences. How certain outcomes have come about is not always clear to the geologist. Therefore it is absolutely important to have the creativity and background knowledge to develop ~10 hypotheses for the genetic history of an outcrop.
- Less is sometimes more. While the instructor must be cognizant to cover the material comprehensively, it is equally important to recognize the point at which more information would be counter-productive.
- Repetition is important. Previously covered materials should be revisited, and understanding reaffirmed continuously.
- Newly-learned topics should be put into perspective of the greater picture by the instructor.

I am prepared to teach courses related to marine geological processes, sedimentology, and (paleo)oceanography. What follows are examples of the type of activities one can expect to see in my classroom:

- Students will be guided through the theoretical foundation of each topic, starting from the first principles and then building on that with practical examples.
- I will promote healthy skepticism and scrutiny, and in so doing I will help students recognize the caveats and underlying assumptions.
- Variable teaching methods will be used to keep things fresh and engaging.
- Field experiences are essential to study outcrops or modern analogs ("The best geologist is who has seen the most rocks" H.H. Read, 1940).
- Assignments will incorporate the use of state-of-the-art technology whenever useful.
- For those interested in more advanced details related to the topic at hand, links to supplementary materials will be provided during each lesson.
- Thesis support will be given as my expertise fits.
