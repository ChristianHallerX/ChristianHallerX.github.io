## Introduction

A Python Machine Learning project for a small geological dataset.

This is a project working out how to model reservoir rock permeability from microscope (thin section) images and make predictions. The typical workflow for a new dataset is explained. However, the public data set is very small and thus it is not easy to obtain good prediction scores.
I encourage you to take a look into the Jupyter notebooks and run the routines yourself and let me know if you got better results!
This project was developed together with `Advanced Data Science with IBM` on Coursera.
