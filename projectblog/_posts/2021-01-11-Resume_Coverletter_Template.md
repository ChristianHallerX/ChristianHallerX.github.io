# Introduction

You want:

* A résumé template that does not fall apart when you add a second page? 
* Plenty of relevant sections to choose from that highlight your accomplishments.
* Matching cover letter and résumé documents that are neihter boring nor look like a unicorn barfed over it?
* Know why are there rubber gloves in the cover picture anyway?

This is going to easy, because this is a LaTeX template that has your needs covered. You are going to build the documents from source code by yourself.

The template code is an evolution of the <a href="https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv" target="_blank"> "Friggeri CV"</a>, which was later substantially enriched in features by Jesper Dramsch in his repo <a href="https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv" target="_blank">"latex-cv-boosted"</a>.


## How to

1. Download or clone <a href="https://github.com/ChristianHallerX/PhD_Resume_and_CoverLetter_Template" target="_blank">this</a> repo.
2. Install LaTeX if you don't already have.
3. Substitute all the placeholders.
4. Build the code to a PDF. Done.

If this sounds compelling, then head over to the GitHub repository to learn more.
