In <a href="https://www.christianhaller.me/blog/projectblog/2023-02-18-ChatGPT_Coding/" target="_blank">Part I</a> of this blog series, we discussed how ChatGPT can help improve your coding skills in various ways.

As a continuation, I experimented with ChatGPT as a coding assistant to develop some simple web-based animations of bouncing squares using JavaScript, a language and area in which I'm not particularly experienced.

In this part, I will share some valuable insights I gained from this process and how you can effectively use ChatGPT to enhance your programming experience and how it goes beyond the introductory suggestions of Part I.


## Write the code in small chunks

Break down your code into smaller, manageable tasks.

In my experiment, I started with a blank web page, then created an object for the window, a class for squares, and so on.

This approach prevents the code from becoming disorganized and difficult to maintain.

Writing code in smaller chunks allows you to focus on individual problems, which can lead to cleaner, more efficient solutions.


## Guide ChatGPT on code architecture

Be specific about how you want your code structured.

Indicate where classes and methods should be placed to avoid creating disorganized spaghetti code.

By giving ChatGPT a clear idea of the desired code architecture, it can generate more organized and maintainable code that aligns with your vision.


## Be aware of ChatGPT's limitations

ChatGPT can make mistakes, so be cautious about overestimating its capabilities.

In my case, I struggled with getting a proper bounce effect for squares, only to realize ChatGPT was using math more suitable for round objects.

When I explicitly instructed it to use an algorithm designed for squares, the result was much better.

Keep in mind that ChatGPT may not always produce the perfect solution, and it may require additional guidance or tweaking to achieve the desired outcome.


## Be mindful of repetitive prompts

If you find yourself repeatedly asking ChatGPT to fix something, it may indicate that you're not providing clear guidance or there's a fundamental flaw in your code architecture.

Consider reevaluating your approach and adjusting your instructions to ChatGPT accordingly.

Reflect on the root cause of the issue and try to address it at its core, rather than attempting to fix the symptoms through multiple prompts.

## Enjoy a less frustrating coding experience

Working with ChatGPT can make coding less frustrating, especially when tackling complex tasks like creating realistic animations.

It can save you time and effort, even if you don't fully understand the code.

By using ChatGPT as a coding assistant, you can leverage its knowledge and expertise to handle challenging problems that might otherwise prove too difficult or time-consuming to solve on your own.


## Use ChatGPT for big-picture questions

ChatGPT can also provide valuable insights into overall concepts, strategies, and best practices.

Asking these types of questions can help you understand better ways to structure your code and tackle complex problems.

Engaging with ChatGPT on a conceptual level can help you broaden your understanding of various programming paradigms, algorithms, and techniques, ultimately leading to more effective and efficient code.


## Understand the code ChatGPT generates

Although it's tempting to rely solely on ChatGPT-generated code, it's crucial to study and understand it to debug subtle issues that may arise.

This practice ensures you maintain control over your code and its functionality.

Take the time to review and comprehend the generated code, and use it as a learning opportunity to expand your programming knowledge and skills.


## ChatGPT is better suited for experienced coders

While ChatGPT is helpful for writing simple functions and scripts, its ability to structure large amounts of maintainable code is limited.

It's most useful for those who already have coding experience, as it can't magically turn amateurs into experts.

To guide ChatGPT on architectural decisions, you need a certain experience what is most flexible, testable, and expandable.
