"Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt" is a book by Michael Lewis that tells the story of a group of individuals who set out to expose and fix the unfair practices of the stock market.

This allows them to gain a significant advantage over other traders and to make large profits.
However, as Lewis explains, this practice also creates a number of problems, such as reducing transparency and fairness in the market and increasing the potential for market manipulation.

The book follows the story of Brad Katsuyama, a former trader who becomes convinced that the stock market is rigged against ordinary investors.
Along with a team of colleagues, Katsuyama sets out to create a new stock exchange that is designed to level the playing field for all investors.

"Flash Boys" is a fascinating and eye-opening look at the inner workings of the stock market and the ways in which it can be manipulated.
