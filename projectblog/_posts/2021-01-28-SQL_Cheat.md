The following post consists of notes I had on my drive and I had been returning to over and over to remind me of some concepts and SQL syntax.

Of course, the original tables and outputs are not available here, but the point is providing a lookup for structures and building blocks.

## CASE

The CASE statement can create a new column based on multiple conditions in a specified column.

The structure always follows `CASE` `WHEN` `THEN` `ELSE` `END` `AS`. The `ELSE` and `AS` are optional

~~~sql
SELECT  
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
		 WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
		 ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain AS m
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id
WHERE m.awayteam_id = 8634;
~~~


### CASE and aggregate function (SUM)

The following query creates multiple new columns with a summation aggregate function.

~~~sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
			 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2012_2013,
				
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
			 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2013_2014,
				
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal
			 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
~~~

### Percentages with AVG and CASE

For each country calculate the percentage of ties (home=away goals_).
Use the `AVG` and `CASE` (for 1,0 assignment) functions.

~~~sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
					WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
					END),2) AS pct_ties_2013_2014,
				   
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
					WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
					END),2) AS pct_ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
~~~

## Subqueries

While regular subqueries can be calculated on their own, correlated subqueries cannot need results from outer queries.
Queries with multiple subqueries will get complicated quickly.


### Subqueries in WHERE clause

~~~sql
SELECT
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team
WHERE team_api_id IN
	(SELECT hometeam_id 
	 FROM match
	 WHERE home_goal >= 8);
~~~


### Subqueries in FROM

~~~sql
SELECT
	country,
	date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM 
	(SELECT c.name AS country, 
			m.date, 
			m.home_goal, 
			m.away_goal,
			(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS total_goals
	FROM match AS m
	LEFT JOIN country AS c
	ON m.country_id = c.id) AS subq
WHERE total_goals >= 10;
~~~


### Subqueries in SELECT

Subqueries in `SELECT` statements generate a single value!

~~~sql
SELECT 
	l.name AS league,
   	ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal), 2) AS avg_goals
	(SELECT ROUND(AVG(home_goal + away_goal), 2) 
     	FROM match
     	WHERE season = '2013/2014') AS overall_avg
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
WHERE season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY league;
~~~


### Correlated Subqueries

Correlated subqueries reference one or more columns in the main query.
They dend on information in the main query to run, and thus, cannot be executed on their own.
Correlated subqueries are evaluated in SQL once per row of data retrieved - a process that takes a lot more computing power and time than a simple subquery.

The following `WHERE` clause filters for entries with total goals higher than three times the average.

~~~sql
SELECT 
	main.country_id,
	date,
	main.home_goal, 
	main.away_goal
FROM match AS main
WHERE 
	(home_goal + away_goal) > 
		(SELECT AVG((sub.home_goal + sub.away_goal) * 3)
		 FROM match AS sub
		 WHERE main.country_id = sub.country_id);
~~~

### Nested Subqueries in FROM

Now it's getting complicated. Best design such queries from inner to outer.

~~~sql
SELECT
	c.name AS country,
	AVG(outer_s.matches) AS avg_seasonal_high_scores
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN (
		SELECT country_id, season,
			COUNT(id) AS matches
		FROM (
			SELECT country_id, season, id
			FROM match
			WHERE home_goal >= 5 OR away_goal >= 5) AS inner_s
		GROUP BY country_id, season) AS outer_s
ON c.id = outer_s.country_id
GROUP BY country;
~~~

## Common Table Expressions (CTE)

CTEs are declared and executed ahead of the main query and help organizing queries with complicated subqueries.

They always precede the main query and go `WITH` cte `AS` (`SELECT`.....)

~~~sql
WITH home AS (
	SELECT m.id,
		m.date,
		t.team_long_name AS hometeam,
		m.home_goal
	FROM match AS m
	LEFT JOIN team AS t 
	ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id),

away AS (
	SELECT m.id,
		m.date, 
		t.team_long_name AS awayteam,
		m.away_goal
  	FROM match AS m
  	LEFT JOIN team AS t 
  	ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id)

SELECT 
	ome.date,
	home.hometeam,
	away.awayteam,
	home.home_goal,
	away.away_goal
FROM home
INNER JOIN away
ON home.id = away.id;
~~~

## OVER()

The `OVER()` clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in `SELECT`, but run faster.

`OVER()` generates column with an aggregate of the complete column and the ame value in each row.

~~~sql
SELECT 
	m.id, 
	c.name AS country, 
   	m.season,
	m.home_goal,
	m.away_goal,
	AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN country AS c ON m.country_id = c.id;
~~~



### RANK() and ORDER BY

Calculate a ranking and also order the query by rank.

The following query calculates the average goals per game and groups by league. The averages are ranked by league.

~~~sql
SELECT 
	l.name AS league,
	AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
	RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) DESC) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
ORDER BY league_rank;
~~~


### Sliding Windows

Keywords for sliding windows are `UNBOUNDED`, `PRECEDING`, `FOLLOWING`, and `CURRENT ROW`

The window is supposed to run sum and averages 

The following query is ascending date ordering (smallest date number at top) -> the window goes from top (oldest date) of table to current row.

~~~sql
SELECT 
	date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
		ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total,
	AVG(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
		ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_avg
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 9908 
	AND season = '2011/2012';
~~~	
	
The following query is descending date ordering (largest date number at top) -> the window goes from current row to bottom (oldest date).

~~~sql
SELECT 
	date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date DESC
		ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS running_total,
	AVG(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date DESC
		ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS running_avg
FROM match
WHERE 
	awayteam_id = 9908 
    AND season = '2011/2012';
~~~
