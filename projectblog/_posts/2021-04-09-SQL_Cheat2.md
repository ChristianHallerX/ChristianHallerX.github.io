Database tables are split up into sub-tables to avoid saving redundant records.
This requires the maintenance of more complex systems, but it may be more efficient after all.
However, while querying and joining we can combine these tables again.
This post contains a number of SQL used for managing values, columns, tables, and databases.

Of course, the original tables and outputs are not available here, but the point is providing a lookup for structures and building blocks.



## Making and Deleting Tables

### Create Table

New tables can be created directly in SQL syntax.

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	column1 dtype,
	column2 dtype,
	column3 dtype
);
~~~

For example:

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE rocktypes (
	ID integer PRIMARY KEY,
	name text NOT NULL,
	type text UNIQUE,
	clevage_angle integer
);
~~~


Most common Data Types:


| DataType              | Description                    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| text                  | String of any length           |
| varchar[ (x) ]        | Maximum length of n characters |
| char[ (x) ]           | String of set length n         |
| boolean               | TRUE, FALSE, NULL              |
| date, time, timestamp | time formats                   |
| numeric               | no precision defined           |
| integer               | -2147483648 to 2147483647      |

### Drop Table

Delete the entire table.

~~~sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
~~~

## Information Schema

### List all Tables

~~~sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
~~~


### List all Columns in a Table

~~~sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'employees' AND table_schema = 'public';
~~~


### List Table Constraints

List all foreign Keys

~~~sql
SELECT constraint_name, table_name, constraint_type
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
~~~




## Insert Into

### Insert a Row

~~~sql
INSERT INTO table_name (existing_column1, existing_column2)
VALUES (val1, val2);
~~~

For Example:

~~~sql
INSERT INTO employee (firstname, lastname, department_shortname)
VALUES (NULL, 'Miller', 'SLS');
~~~

### Insert a Column

~~~sql
INSERT INTO table_name
SELECT column1
FROM old_table;
~~~

For Example:

Use DISTINCT to remove duplicate records.

~~~sql
INSERT INTO rocktypes
SELECT DISTINCT outcrop, handpiece
FROM samples;

/* double check */
SELECT *
FROM rocktypes;
~~~

## Update Table

Similar as INSERT INTO column, but with additional conditoins.


~~~sql
UPDATE connections
SET connections.employee_id = employees.id
FROM employees
WHERE connections.firstname = employees.firstname AND connections.lastname = employees.lastname;
~~~

## Delete Entries

Delete rows selectively where conditions are met.

~~~sql
DELETE FROM organizations
WHERE id = 'ABC';
~~~


## Alter Table

### Rename Column

Have you made a type when creating a table?

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_colname TO new_colname;
~~~


### Add Column

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN id varchar(128);
~~~


### Drop Column

Delete a column in a table.

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
~~~


### Column Type

After creation, the datatype of a column can still be modified.
Extension of a string lenghth is easy.

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name
TYPE varchar(256);
~~~

Shortening the length of a value requires a processing step first. For example, a float type gets rounded first and then cast to integer type.

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name
TYPE integer
USING ROUND(long_num_value);
~~~

For example, when shortening string entries,a 'SUBSTRING' has to be created first selecting the characters from 1 to x.

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name
TYPE varchar(16)
USING SUBSTRING(column_name FROM 1 FOR 16)
~~~


### Set Not Null, Drop Not Null

By default, a colum can contain NULL values. A column's 'NOT NULL' flag can be set after the table was created.

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name
SET NOT NULL;
~~~

Remove 'NOT NULL'.

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name
DROP NOT NULL;
~~~


### Unique Constraint

Note: The unique constraint will require a new column be created.

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT new_col_name UNIQUE(column_name);
~~~


### Primary Key Constraint

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT new_col_name PRIMARY KEY(old_col_name);
~~~


### Primary Key / Add Surrogate Key Column

Add a primary key serial type.	

~~~sql
ALTER Table table_name
ADD COLUMN id serial PRIMARY KEY;
~~~

### Foreign Key Constraint (1 to n)

Generate a foreign key column that references a primary key in another table.

Assuming a star pattern schema, the central table will get a foreign key added to an central_table_id that refernece the branch_id.


~~~sql
ALTER TABLE [central_table] 
ADD CONSTRAINT [my_name_for_FKey_constraint] FOREIGN KEY (central_table_id) REFERENCES [branch_table] (branch_id);
~~~

For example:

Inserting entries into the employees table that violate the foreign key table, e.g. non-existing company, will result in error.

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE employees 
ADD CONSTRAINT employees_fkey FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies (id);
~~~

Drop / Delete a Foreign Key Column

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE connections
DROP CONSTRAINT connections_organization_id_fkey;
~~~


### Foreign Key Constraint (n to m)

This is two foreign key columns referencing other tables in a many to many relationship.

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE connections (
    employee_id integer REFERENCES employees (id),
    organization_id varchar(256) REFERENCES organizations (id),
    function varchar(256)
	);
~~~


### Key Referential Integrity

Foreign Keys referencing other tables can be used to prevent entering or deleting data that is not given/referred to in the other table.

We can determine what happens to the referenced table if an entry of our foreign key gets deleted.

Example: NO ACTION

If you delete an entry in table b, the system will raise an error.

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE a (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    column_1 varchar(64),
    b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE NO ACTION
	);
~~~

Example: CASCADE

If you delete an entry in table b, all referencing entries in table a will be deleted, too.	

~~~sql
CREATE TABLE a (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    column_1 varchar(64),
    b_id integer REFERENCES b (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    );
~~~

~~~sql
ALTER TABLE connections
ADD CONSTRAINT connections_organization_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
~~~


| ON DELETE... | Description                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| NO ACTION    | Error                                  |
| CASCADE      | Delete all referencing entries         |
| RESTRICT     | Error                                  |
| SET NULL     | Set referencing entry to NULL          |
| SET DEFAULT  | Set referencing entry to default value |

## Triggers

### Data Manipulation: AFTER triggers

Use after INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE data manipulation.

The table 'deleted' and 'iserted' are automatically created by SQL Server.

~~~sql
CREATE TRIGGER TrackDeletedProducts
ON ProductsTable
AFTER DELETE
AS
    INSERT INTO DeletedProducts (Product, Price)
    SELECT Product, Price
    FROM deleted;
~~~

### Data Manipulation: INSTEAD OF triggers

Use instead of INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE data manipulation.

~~~sql
CREATE TRIGGER PreventProductsUpdate
ON Products
INSTEAD OF UPDATE
AS
    RAISERROR ('Updates on "Products" table are not permitted.', 16, 1);
~~~

### Data Definition: FOR triggers

FOR triggers can only be run after, not instead of. That means 'FOR' is a synonym for 'AFTER'.

The 'DATABASE' level includes all tables in the database.

~~~sql
CREATE TRIGGER TrackTableChanges
ON DATABASE
FOR CREATE_TABLE,
    ALTER_TABLE,
    DROP_TABLE
AS
    INSERT INTO TablesLog (EventData, User)
    VALUES (EVENTDATA(), USER);
~~~

While 'FOR' statements do not prevent execution like 'INSTEAD OF', they can be rolled back.

~~~sql
CREATE TRIGGER PreventTableDrop
ON DATABASE
FOR DROP_TABLE
AS
    RAISERROR ('DROP is not allowed.', 16, 1);
    ROLLBACK;
~~~

### Listing all trigger in the system

Server-level triggers:
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM sys.server_triggers;
~~~

Database + Table-level triggers (see column 'parent_class_desc'):
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM sys.triggers;
~~~

### Viewing a specific trigger

The name of a specific trigger has to be known and then can be entered as object_id.

Method 1:
~~~sql
SELECT definition
FROM sys.sql_modules
WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID ('PreventTableDrop');
~~~

Method 2:
~~~sql
SELECT OBJECT_DEFINITION (OBJECT_ID ('PreventTableDrop'));
~~~


### Listing all server, DB, and table triggers with definitions

~~~sql
SELECT name AS TriggerName,
       parent_class_desc AS TriggerType,
       create_date AS CreateDate,
       modify_date AS LastModifiedDate,
       is_disabled AS Disabled,
       is_instead_of_trigger AS InsteadOfTrigger,
       OBJECT_DEFINITION  (object_id)
FROM sys.triggers
UNION ALL
SELECT name AS TriggerName,
       parent_class_desc AS TriggerType,
       create_date AS CreateDate,
       modify_date AS LastModifiedDate,
       is_disabled AS Disabled,
       0 AS InsteadOfTrigger,
       OBJECT_DEFINITION  (object_id)
FROM sys.server_triggers
ORDER BY TriggerName;
~~~
